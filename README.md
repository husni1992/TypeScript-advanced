# Mastering TypeScript: From Basics to Advanced
As JavaScript developers, we often miss out on the full potential of TypeScript in our everyday coding. TypeScript has a lot of powerful features that can enhance our development work. In this project, we're on a journey to become TypeScript experts. We'll cover a range of features, starting from the basics and gradually moving to more advanced topics. Our main focus will be on the following TypeScript features:

## Features We'll Explore
| Feature                | Status     | Description                                            |
|------------------------|----------- |--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Type Annotations    | ‚úÖ Done    | Specify types for variables, parameters, returns.      |
| 2. Interfaces          | ‚úÖ Done    | Define structure for objects and contracts.            |
| 3. Classes             | ‚úÖ Done    | Blueprint for creating objects with methods & props.   |
| 4. Enums               | ‚úÖ Done    | Set of named constants; usable as objects in JS.       |
| 5. Generics            | ‚úÖ Done    | Create flexible, reusable components with types.       |
| 6. Type Guards         | ‚úÖ Done    | Runtime type check returning boolean on verification.  |
| 7. Tuples              | ‚úÖ Done    | Fixed-length arrays with typed elements.               |
| 8. Union Types         | ‚úÖ Done    | Combine multiple types into one.                       |
| 9. Intersection Types  | ‚úÖ Done    | Merge types by combining properties.                   |
| 10. Literal Types      | ‚úÖ Done    | Restrict types to specific values.                     |
| 11. Nullable Types     | ‚úÖ Done    | Allow types to be null or undefined.                   |
| 12. Type Aliases       | ‚úÖ Done    | Custom type definitions for readability.               |
| 13. Mapped Types       | ‚úÖ Done    | Transform types by iterating over properties.          |
| 14. Conditional Types  | ‚úÖ Done    | Types dependent on conditions.                         |
| 15. Decorators         | ‚úÖ Done    | Annotate and modify classes, functions and properties. |
| 16. Mixins             | ‚ùå Pending | Combine multiple classes into one.                     |
| 17. Utility Types      | üöß Ongoing | Built-in types for common type transformations.        |
| 18. Advanced Types     | ‚ùå Pending | Explore complex type patterns and techniques.          |
| 19. Module Augmentation| ‚ùå Pending | Extend modules with additional features.               |
| 20. Namespaces         | ‚úÖ Done    | Organize code with logical grouping.                   |
| 21. Advanced Generics  | ‚úÖ Done    | Extend generics for complex use cases.                 |

## Project Goals
This initiative is one of my key goals for 2023. This repository will serve as a comprehensive reference for every developer working with TypeScript. It aims to not only enhance our collective understanding of TypeScript's capabilities but also to streamline our development processes by leveraging its advanced features.
