# Mastering TypeScript: From Basics to Advanced

As JavaScript developers, we often underutilize the full potential of TypeScript in our day-to-day coding. TypeScript offers a plethora of advanced features that many of us might not be familiar with. This project is a journey to master TypeScript, covering a wide range of features from the basic to the advanced. Our focus will be on the following features, with the understanding that this list may evolve and expand over time.

## Features We'll Explore

1. **Type Annotations**: Defining types for variables, parameters, and return types.
2. **Interfaces**: Creating the `IUser` interface to define the structure of user objects.
3. **Classes**: Implementing the `User` class to create user objects.
4. **Enums**: Using the `UserRole` enum to define user roles.
5. **Functions**: Developing various functions in services and controllers.
6. **Generics**: Creating a reusable service class with `GenericService<T>`.
7. **Type Guards**: Implementing the `isUser` function to check if an object is an instance of `User`.
8. **Tuples**: (Implementation Pending)
9. **Union and Intersection Types**: (Implementation Pending)
10. **Literal Types**: (Implementation Pending)
11. **Nullable Types**: Incorporating optional properties in interfaces and classes.
12. **Type Aliases**: (Implementation Pending)
13. **Mapped Types**: (Implementation Pending)
14. **Conditional Types**: (Implementation Pending)
15. **Decorators**: (Implementation Pending)
16. **Mixins**: (Implementation Pending)
17. **Utility Types**: (Implementation Pending)
18. **Advanced Types**: (Implementation Pending)
19. **Module Augmentation**: (Implementation Pending)
20. **Namespaces**: (Implementation Pending)
21. **Advanced Generics**: (Implementation Pending)

## Project Goals

This initiative is one of my key goals for 2023 at [Your Company Name]. This repository will serve as a comprehensive reference for every developer working with TypeScript. It aims to not only enhance our collective understanding of TypeScript's capabilities but also to streamline our development processes by leveraging its advanced features.
