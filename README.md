# Mastering TypeScript: From Basics to Advanced Features

TypeScript has become an essential tool in modern web development, empowering developers to write more maintainable and error-resistant code. This repository is your one-stop shop for mastering TypeScript, covering everything from core concepts to advanced features. More than just theory, you'll find practical examples for every feature, encouraging experimentation and adaptation to your own projects. I welcome your feedback and contributions to make this a valuable resource for the entire TypeScript community.

## ðŸ’¡ Side Note
Think of this project as your practical guide to TypeScript. It showcases TypeScript features in action, although it might not always stick to Node.js API application best practices.
